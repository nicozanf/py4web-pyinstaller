How to make py4web binaries for Windows and MacOS with PY3 and pyinstaller

The binaries contain Python 64 bit version 3.7.4 with all the needed modules
and the py4web in the specified version. You don't need anything else to run them!

## Why binaries versions?

Using the binaries is much simpler and quicker if you're just learning web2py or testing your existing code with different python
versions. For a newbie, even properly installing Python could be a nightmare! Also, in this way you're sure you don't risk any damage on
your system and you can do it even if you're not an administrator.  
But you should use the latest available Python version and the web2py sources (and possibly a full web server) for Production and
complex / unusual development. 

## Status

The binaries for Windows are already working, but they seem to have some problem with the Edge browser (just don't use it).  
the Mac version is still in progress.

## Instructions

Just downoad the correct zip file and unzip it in a folder. On a command prompt, goto that folder and run 'py4web-start apps'. 

If you prefer to build them by yourself, see the specific README [for Windows](https://github.com/nicozanf/py4web-pyinstaller/blob/master/README_win.md) and [for Mac](https://github.com/nicozanf/py4web-pyinstaller/blob/master/README_mac.md).
